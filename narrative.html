	<div class="draggable">using a walk behind mower. I have probably another three and a half hours to go. I'm hoping the weather holds. I want to break it up into at least two days. If I had known for sure I was going to mow I wouldn't have gone to the gym this morning. There is some weeding I need to do and Friday I get 5 yards of compost delivered. Don't even get me started on all the brush I need to cut back. No rest for this Twisted, Evil thing.</div>
	<div class="draggable">the morning, the Steller and Scrub Jays also go for it. I try to put it where the cat doesn't have any cover to hide. I also put some up on a ledge just for the birds, but the cat has taken to jumping up there first, eating that kibble before sitting by his bowl. The jays are clever and cautious and have been stealing the catfood for years. Lately the Towhee and Junco are also going for the kibble. There have been a few causualties.  

I put sunflower seeds in feeders for the birds, and on the ground in safe places for the ground feeders, but apparently they have developed a taste for kibble. I find it interesting that after all these years the other birds are suddenly going for the kibble. I wonder if they observed the Jays and said, I want some of that!</div>
	<div class="draggable">One day without conflict. Just one......turn the battleships around. Shut off the rockets. Get the troops home, heal the vets Stop talking walls and get out there. And for Christsakes......enough with the mother of all bombs bullshit.

You all know Henry rollins? Amazing life story of conscious decisions. He spins a globe, stops it with a finger and says "I'm going there to meet someone of a different culture" all this after screaming out anger on stage for years with black flag.

America......you can laugh yourself into enlightenment if you choose. It's that easy.

Have fun today people.</div>
