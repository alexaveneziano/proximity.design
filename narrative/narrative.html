	<div class="draggable">using a walk behind mower. I have probably another three and a half hours to go. I'm hoping the weather holds. I want to break it up into at least two days. If I had known for sure I was going to mow I wouldn't have gone to the gym this morning. There is some weeding I need to do and Friday I get 5 yards of compost delivered. Don't even get me started on all the brush I need to cut back. No rest for this Twisted, Evil thing.</div>
